Experience the thrill of a game of Pacman as if you were Pacman. Our project is simply the game of Pacman designed for Oculus and Gear VR. The game is powered by Unity Game Engine. Movement is controlled either thru keys or an Xbox game controller. In addition the camera tracks head movement making it possible to peek around corners and see if there is a ghost coming. The ghosts use a pathfinding algorithm to seek the player, but are sometimes diverted by random events to ease the difficulty.
